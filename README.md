# [bracketize]

Bracketize is an app for generating and "playing" March-Madness-style brackets for pretty much anything. It currently only supports "voted" brackets, where users vote for one of two "contenders" in each match. Once the match is closed the contender with the most points wins and advances.

Bracketize is written in [ember.js](http://emberjs.com/) and backed by Firebase.
